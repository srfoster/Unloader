The Unloader Project
********************

Unity3D doesn't support animated GIFs in GUIs.  This can make it difficult to add loading indicators to your games.

This project currently contains a single (not-very-customizable) example of a loading indicator.  Feel free to use it as a launching point for building your own loading indicators.  If you make something awesome, feel free to contribute to this project.
